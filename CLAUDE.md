# CLAUDE.md — Project Kairos

## Project Overview

Kairos is a concurrency-safe resource booking engine. The core differentiator: no two
overlapping bookings for the same resource can ever both succeed, because the guarantee is
enforced by a PostgreSQL exclusion constraint at the schema level — not by application
check-then-insert logic — so no code path, present or future, can bypass it.

## Source Documents

All six approved planning documents live under `docs/`, committed verbatim:

| # | Document | Path |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | PRD v1.0 | `docs/01-prd.md` |
| 2 | RFC / Technical Design Doc v1.0 | `docs/02-rfc.md` |
| 3 | API & Data Design Spec v1.0 | `docs/03-api-data-spec.md` |
| 4 | Test Plan / Acceptance Criteria v1.0 | `docs/04-test-plan.md` |
| 5 | Rollout & Runbook v1.0 | `docs/05-rollout-runbook.md` |
| 6 | Implementation Plan v1.0 | `docs/06-implementation-plan.md` |

The Implementation Plan (`docs/06-implementation-plan.md`) is the document actually being
executed against, one phase per session. Read its §1 (Project-Wide Rules) before starting
any phase.

## Current Architecture State

`infra/docker-compose.yml` runs PostgreSQL 16 with `btree_gist` enabled and
`max_connections=600` (spike/test setting — see the file's comment); it also provisions a
`kairos_test` database via `infra/init-test-db.sql`. `scripts/spike/` is throwaway spike code
(RFC §16) that produced `docs/spikes/S1-postgres-verification.md` and does not become the
application.

A Django project now exists under `backend/kairos/`, structured per RFC §4.1:

`POST /api/v1/bookings` is live and idempotent (Phase 5 — `Idempotency-Key` is required;
missing it is 400). No other endpoints, no real auth (Phase 9 — currently a dev-only
`X-Dev-User-Id` header stub, clearly marked `# STUB` in
`kairos/identity/authentication.py`). `backend/.venv/` is local and gitignored; recreate with
`python -m venv .venv && pip install -e ".[dev]"` from `backend/`.

## Completed Phases

| Phase | Name | One-line summary | Merged |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Repository & Process Foundation | Scaffolding, six docs committed, CLAUDE.md/README.md initialized, CI skeleton | Pending (direct-to-main commit) |
| 1 | Spike S1 — Postgres Verification | All of RFC §16 S1.1–S1.7 verified against real PostgreSQL 16; gate PASSED; Candidate A confirmed. One liveness finding carried forward (see below) | Pending (on branch `phase-01-spike-postgres-verification`) |
| 2 | Core Schema & The Exclusion Constraint | Django project scaffolded (Django 6.1); `app_user`, `resource`, `resource_admin`, `booking` created via migrations; `no_overlapping_bookings` EXCLUDE constraint added via raw SQL with the Spec §3 comment block reproduced verbatim; smoke test confirms SQLSTATE 23P01 on sequential overlap; ruff + mypy strict pass with zero findings | Pending (on branch `phase-02-core-schema-exclusion-constraint`) |
| 3 | Concurrency Proof & CI Pipeline 🏁 Milestone 1 | Barrier-released concurrency harness (`tests/concurrency/harness.py`); CONC-01 (N=200, 10 runs), CONC-02 (partial + 5-way chained overlap), CONC-05 (cancel-and-rebook race) all pass reliably; RECON-05 CI-form schema assertion added and verified to fail on a manually narrowed predicate; full CI pipeline (`lint`, `test`, `concurrency` — three separate jobs) wired up; two new empirical findings beyond the carried-forward 40P01 one (see Key Technical Decisions) | Pending (on branch `phase-03-concurrency-proof-ci`) |
| 4 | Service Layer & Booking Creation API | DRF wired up (`/api/v1`, JSON only); `POST /api/v1/bookings` live with policy validation (bookable hours, max duration, past-dating, 365-day horizon), stub `X-Dev-User-Id` auth, `X-Request-Id` on every response, structured JSON logging, and the Spec §6 error envelope on every error path; `BookingService.create_booking` catches all four write-path SQLSTATEs specifically (23P01→409, 55P03/40P01/57014→503+Retry-After); verified live against the real dev server (not just the test client); all Phase 2/3 tests still pass | Pending (on branch `phase-04-booking-creation-api`) |
| 5 | Idempotency — The Transaction Boundary ⚠️ Subtle | `idempotency_key` table with a genuine composite `(user_id, key)` PRIMARY KEY (Django 6.1's `CompositePrimaryKey` — no surrogate-key workaround needed here, unlike Phase 2's `resource_admin`); `run_idempotent_write` (generic, in `core`, reused by every future write path) claims the key and runs the protected write in one transaction per RFC §11.2, recording a 409 outcome in its own follow-up transaction after rollback, and recording nothing at all for a 503 (outcome genuinely unknown); IDEM-01–04, 06 (100 reps), 09, 10, 11 all pass; verified live (replay returns the original booking, not a 409) | Pending (on branch `phase-05-idempotency`) |

## Current Phase In Progress

None. Phase 5 is complete pending review and merge. Phase 6 (Read Path & Availability View)
is next.

## NOT Yet Built

No read endpoints (Phase 6), no edit/cancel (Phase 7), no real authentication (Phase 9 —
`X-Dev-User-Id` is an explicitly marked stub), no Celery/Redis, no frontend, no hold
reclamation (booking creation does not yet run the cleanup-on-write DELETE from Spec §4.1
step 2, since `held` rows don't exist until Phase 15), no
`recurring_series`/`waitlist_entry`/`waitlist_offer`/`audit_log`/`system_check_run` tables
(each arrives with the phase that needs it — see the Key Technical Decisions and Phase Index
in `docs/06-implementation-plan.md`). IDEM-05 (recurring replay) needs Phase 12's endpoint;
IDEM-07/08 (fault injection — process kill mid-transaction, proxy-level response drop) need
tooling that arrives in Phase 28; idempotency coverage on cancel/edit/waitlist/confirm
arrives with those endpoints (Phases 7, 14, 16). `booking.series_id` does not
exist yet — it cannot, since `recurring_series` (Phase 11) doesn't exist; it is added in
Phase 11, not retrofitted early. CONC-03/CONC-04 (edit-vs-create, edit-vs-edit races) don't
exist yet — Phase 7, when editing exists. CONC-01's full 100-run + N=500 escalation and
CONC-06 (throughput characterization) are deferred to Phase 28/29 respectively; CI only runs
the 10-run CI-tier reduction. The throwaway spike table `spike_booking` may still exist in
`kairos_dev`, created/dropped repeatedly by `scripts/spike/common.py` — unrelated to the real
schema. Do not assume any of the above exist in a fresh session — verify against this file
and `git log` first.

## Key Technical Decisions (with source references)

| Decision | Why | Source |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL EXCLUDE constraint over distributed locking, `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, or SERIALIZABLE isolation | The guarantee lives at the schema level and cannot be bypassed by any code path, present or future — unlike alternatives where the guarantee depends on session config or application discipline | RFC v1.0 §3.3 |
| Constraint predicate covers `status IN ('confirmed', 'held')` | Waitlist holds must occupy the same exclusion domain as confirmed bookings, or a waitlist offer reserves nothing and an ordinary user can take the slot mid-offer | RFC v1.0 §10.1 |
| Idempotency key written in the same transaction as the booking insert | A separate transaction leaves a window where the booking commits and the key doesn't; the retry then tells the user their own successful booking is unavailable | RFC v1.0 §11.2 |
| Audit trail is trigger-based, not application-based | An application-level audit is opt-in per code path; a future bulk-import script would skip it. A trigger cannot be skipped by any writer | RFC v1.0 §12 |
| Two independent correctness monitors in production: schema assertion + reconciliation | Schema assertion detects the constraint being removed (the cause) before anyone is harmed; reconciliation detects an actual overlap (the consequence) if it somehow still happens | RFC v1.0 §14 |
| Hold expiry uses two mechanisms — cleanup-on-write AND a periodic reaper | A constraint predicate cannot reference `now()` (not IMMUTABLE), so expired holds must be actively reclaimed; cleanup-on-write makes the system self-healing even if the reaper stalls, but only the reaper drives cascade when there's no booking traffic | RFC v1.0 §10.4 |
| Recurring series store local wall-clock time + IANA zone identifier, not a fixed UTC offset | An offset can't express when DST rules change; each occurrence is independently converted to UTC using the rules in effect on its own date | RFC v1.0 §9.2 |
| Recurring series creation is a two-step preview → confirm flow | PRD FR33 requires the user to explicitly see and acknowledge which occurrences conflict, rather than silently creating a partial series | RFC v1.0 §5d, Spec v1.0 §5.8–5.9 |
| Waitlist eligibility is containment (`@>`), not overlap (`&&`) | The freed range must fully contain the entry's requested range — the strictest defensible rule, chosen because "next eligible user" admitted two readings in an earlier draft | PRD v1.0 FR21 |
| Spike S1 gate: PASSED. Candidate A (exclusion constraint) confirmed on real PostgreSQL 16 | `btree_gist` available; predicate accepted; blocking-not-fail-fast confirmed; `now()` in a predicate correctly rejected (42P17), confirming Phase 17's dual-reclamation design is necessary; cleanup-on-write showed zero deadlocks across 10,000 attempts | `docs/spikes/S1-postgres-verification.md` |
| `BookingService` (Phase 4) must treat SQLSTATE `40P01` (deadlock) the same as `55P03` (lock timeout) — 503 + retry, never a bare failure | Spike S1.2: at N=200 truly-simultaneous identical-slot contention (the extreme worst case), 2/10 runs produced deadlock cascades where the constraint's lack of fixed lock ordering (unlike a btree unique index) let a circular wait form. Safety held 10/10 (never more than one success) — only liveness was at risk, and it's retryable | `docs/spikes/S1-postgres-verification.md` §S1.2 Consequences |
| The EXCLUDE constraint is added via a raw-SQL migration (`RunSQL`), not Django's `ExclusionConstraint` ORM class | The Spec §3 comment block — the primary mitigation against RUNBOOK-01 cause #1 (someone narrowing the predicate during an unrelated migration) — needs to be reproduced verbatim at the point of definition; a raw SQL migration is where that text actually lives, byte for byte | Implementation Plan Phase 2 scope; RFC v1.0 §3.4 |
| `resource_admin`'s composite PK `(resource_id, user_id)` from Spec §3 is modeled as a surrogate `id` + `UniqueConstraint` in Django | Django's ORM ergonomics around composite primary keys are still immature; the surrogate key still enforces the identical one-grant-per-pair guarantee at the DB level — a Django-ergonomics deviation, not a correctness one | `kairos/identity/models.py` (`ResourceAdmin`) |
| Django's built-in `auth`/`contenttypes` apps are deliberately excluded from `INSTALLED_APPS` | Authentication is delegated to SSO/OIDC (RFC v1.0 §4, Phase 9) — Django's `User`/`Permission` machinery has no role here and would add unused tables that don't correspond to anything in Spec §3 | `kairos/settings/base.py` |
| `BookingService` (Phase 4) must also treat SQLSTATE `57014` (`query_canceled`, i.e. `statement_timeout` fired) the same as `55P03`/`40P01` — 503 + retry | Phase 3 CONC-01 empirical finding, reproducible at N=200: under the heaviest pileups, most losers don't block cleanly on one uncommitted competitor for a single >3s stretch (which `lock_timeout` would catch) — they accumulate many shorter waits under GiST index contention that together exceed `statement_timeout` (10s) before any one wait exceeds `lock_timeout`. Safety was unaffected in every observed run | `tests/concurrency/harness.py` (`EXPECTED_NONSUCCESS_SQLSTATES`) |
| At N=200 identical-slot contention, a single barrier-released round can — rarely — produce **zero** successes, not just "not exactly one": every competitor, including whichever would have won, can end up entangled in the same 57014/40P01 pileup | This is a liveness characteristic of the current, provisional timeout budget (RFC v1.0 §18 already flags `lock_timeout` as "tune from CONC-01's observed rate" — this is exactly that signal), not a safety violation. The concurrency tests retry a round only when it produced zero successes (bounded, `MAX_ROUND_ATTEMPTS = 3`); more than one success on any single attempt fails immediately and is never retried, so a real safety violation can never be masked | `tests/concurrency/test_conc_01.py`, `test_conc_02.py`, `test_conc_05.py` |
| CI's `concurrency` job starts Postgres via a plain `docker run` (`-c max_connections=600`), not the `services:` block used by the `test` job | GitHub Actions' `services:` block can't override a container's startup command, and CONC-01 alone opens 200 simultaneous connections — well past Postgres's default `max_connections=100`. Same setting as `infra/docker-compose.yml`, same reason (spike/test-scale concurrency, not production sizing) | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Write-path session settings and the audit actor variables are applied via `SELECT set_config(name, value, true)`, not literal `SET LOCAL ...` SQL text | `set_config`'s third argument (`is_local`) is the functional equivalent of `SET LOCAL`, but as a plain function call it safely accepts bind parameters — `actor_id`/`request_id` are request-influenced values, and interpolating them directly into `SET` statement text would be an injection risk `set_config` avoids entirely | `kairos/bookings/services.py` (`apply_write_path_session_settings`) |
| `PolicyValidationError` (custom, not DRF's `ValidationError`) carries a single `{"field", "issue"}` pair and is raised directly from `serializer.validate()`, stopping at the first violation | Spec v1.0 §6's `validation_error` details example is one flat field/issue pair, not DRF's default per-field list-of-messages aggregation. Because it isn't `rest_framework.exceptions.ValidationError`, DRF's `is_valid()` doesn't intercept it — it propagates straight to `kairos_exception_handler`, which builds the exact shape | `kairos/core/exceptions.py`, `kairos/bookings/serializers.py` |
| `REST_FRAMEWORK["UNAUTHENTICATED_USER"]` is explicitly `None` | DRF's default is the string path to `django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser` — importing that module pulls in `ContentType`, which fails because `contenttypes` isn't installed (Phase 2's deliberate decision). `None` makes DRF leave `request.user` as `None` for anonymous requests instead, which `IsAuthenticated` already handles correctly without needing `contenttypes` at all | `kairos/settings/base.py` |
| `StubUserIdAuthentication.authenticate_header()` returns `"X-Dev-User-Id"` instead of the `BaseAuthentication` default of `None` | Without a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge available, DRF's `APIView.handle_exception()` silently downgrades `NotAuthenticated` from 401 to 403 (HTTP requires a challenge header alongside a bare 401). Spec v1.0 §5.1 documents 401 specifically for `unauthorized` | `kairos/identity/authentication.py` |
| `BookingService.create_booking` calls `booking.refresh_from_db()` immediately after `Booking.objects.create(...)` | `.create()` leaves fields exactly as assigned in Python — `time_range` stays the plain tuple passed in, not the `Range` object a fresh `SELECT` returns, which broke response serialization (`AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'lower'`) until this was added. Also correctly picks up the generated `starts_at` column and the DB-stored `created_at` precision | `kairos/bookings/services.py` |
| CONC-01/02/05's `MAX_ROUND_ATTEMPTS` raised from 3 to 6 | Phase 4's "confirm all CONC tests still pass" check caught real flakiness: at N=200 the per-attempt zero-success rate is ~15-20%, so 3 consecutive zero-success attempts (retry budget exhausted) happened in a live run during this phase — a ~5% chance of flaking any given 10-run suite at the old value. 6 pushes that below ~0.1%. **Relevant to Phase 28**: the full 100-run CONC-01 exercise multiplies this same per-run risk by 10×; revisit this budget (or the underlying timeout tuning RFC v1.0 §18 already flags) before that phase, not after it flakes | `tests/concurrency/test_conc_01.py`, `test_conc_02.py`, `test_conc_05.py` |
| `idempotency_key`'s PK uses Django 6.1's `models.CompositePrimaryKey("user_id", "key")` — a genuine composite PK, not the surrogate-key-plus-`UniqueConstraint` workaround `resource_admin` needed in Phase 2 | Phase 5's DoD explicitly verifies the PK via `\d idempotency_key`; `CompositePrimaryKey` (new since Django 5.2) makes this a real composite PK now rather than requiring a workaround. Confirmed via `psql \d`: `idempotency_key_pkey PRIMARY KEY, btree (user_id, key)` | `kairos/core/models.py` |
| Write-path session settings are applied ONCE at the top of `run_idempotent_write`'s outer transaction, before the key-claim INSERT — not left to `BookingService`'s own (redundant, too-late) internal call | The key-claim INSERT is now the FIRST statement in the transaction (Spec v1.0 §4.1's literal ordering) — if `lock_timeout` etc. were only applied inside the nested `create_booking()` call, a concurrent replay's key-claim insert would block using Postgres's default (no timeout) instead of the intended 3s budget, undermining IDEM-06's request_in_progress path entirely. Extracted the shared helper into `kairos/core/db.py` (RFC §4.1's "db helpers," reserved since Phase 2) so both `BookingService` and the idempotency wrapper call the identical function — the nested call inside `create_booking()` re-applies the same values harmlessly | `kairos/core/db.py`, `kairos/core/idempotency.py` |
| A 409 `slot_unavailable` idempotency outcome is recorded in its OWN, separate transaction after the write's transaction rolls back — never inside the same transaction as the failed write | RFC v1.0 §11.2 states this explicitly ("in its own transaction after the rollback"). The failed write's rollback undoes the ENTIRE transaction, including the key claim — there is nothing left to `UPDATE`, so the 409 outcome must be a fresh `INSERT` in a new transaction. A 503 outcome is the opposite: nothing is recorded at all, since the write's outcome is genuinely unknown (Spec v1.0 §5.1) and a retry with the same key should start completely fresh, not receive a stale "unknown" result | `kairos/core/idempotency.py` (`run_idempotent_write`, `_record_conflict_outcome`) |
| Policy validation (bookable hours, duration, past-dating, horizon) happens BEFORE the idempotency key is ever claimed, not inside the protected transaction | Spec v1.0 §7 point 7 ("conflict outcomes are recorded too") is scoped to 409 specifically, not general validation failures — and a malformed/policy-violating request has nothing worth protecting or replaying. Validating first also means a request that will never succeed doesn't consume a key slot | `kairos/bookings/views.py` (`BookingCreateView.post`) |
| `BookingResponseSerializer.start`/`.end` changed from `SerializerMethodField` (returning a raw `datetime`) to `DateTimeField(source="time_range.lower"/".upper")` | A raw datetime returned by `SerializerMethodField` gets formatted differently by two different code paths: Django's `DjangoJSONEncoder` (used when storing the response into `IdempotencyKey.response_body`, a JSONField) truncates microseconds to milliseconds, while DRF's own response renderer preserves full microsecond precision — producing two different strings for the identical instant and breaking IDEM-02's "identical stored response returned verbatim." Formatting to a string once, through the same `DateTimeField` code path `created_at` already used, fixed it | `kairos/bookings/serializers.py` |

## Running Locally

```bash
cd infra
docker compose up -d
docker exec kairos_postgres psql -U kairos -d kairos_dev -c "SELECT 1;"

cd ../backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate      # Windows; `source .venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python manage.py migrate    # DATABASE_URL defaults to the docker-compose credentials above
python manage.py runserver  # POST /api/v1/bookings is live — see README.md for a curl example
```

The frontend starts Phase 23.

## Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/concurrency -v   # Milestone 1 — the project's central proof, run this first
pytest                        # full suite: the above + smoke test + schema assertion
```

`tests/concurrency/` — CONC-01 (N=200 identical-slot, 10 runs), CONC-02 (partial + 5-way
chained overlap, 10 runs each), CONC-05 (cancel-and-rebook race, 10 runs). Each round is
retried up to 3 times only if it produced zero successes (a documented liveness
characteristic — see Key Technical Decisions); more than one success on any single attempt
fails immediately and is never retried. `tests/test_schema_assertion.py` (RECON-05 CI form)
fails the moment `no_overlapping_bookings`'s predicate is narrowed — verified by hand during
Phase 3 (narrowed it, watched the test fail, reverted). `tests/bookings/` covers
`BookingService` (session-settings assertion, all four SQLSTATE translations — 55P03 forced
genuinely via a real held row, 40P01/57014 forced by simulation since natural reproduction
isn't controllable on demand), the API (every Test Plan §10 policy-validation row, 409, 404,
401, `X-Request-Id`), and idempotency (`test_idempotency.py`, Phase 5) — IDEM-01–04, 06 (100
barrier-released repetitions), 09, 10, 11, plus the composite-PK schema check and the cleanup
command. Also runnable:
`cd backend && ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy kairos` (all pass with zero
findings as of Phase 5). CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs all of this as three jobs —
`lint`, `test`, `concurrency` — on every PR. The spike scripts under `scripts/spike/` are
runnable but are diagnostic, not a test suite — see
`docs/spikes/S1-postgres-verification.md` for what each one does and its recorded output.

## Open Questions

None from Phase 0. From Phase 1's spike:

- **S1.1 on the real deployment target is still unverified.** No deployment platform has
  been chosen yet. Only local Docker PostgreSQL 16 has been confirmed. Must be re-checked
  once a platform is chosen, and again before Phase 30 go-live (Rollout v1.0 §2.2).
- **S1.6's throughput numbers are a local, connection-overhead-dominated baseline**, not a
  production ceiling — Phase 29 (Test Plan CONC-06) re-measures this against a pooled,
  production-shaped topology.

Genuine open questions from the source documents (offer window duration, nonexistent-time
policy default, series bounds, etc.) are tracked in PRD v1.0 §11 and RFC v1.0 §18; they get
resolved or explicitly deferred as the relevant phases are built.
